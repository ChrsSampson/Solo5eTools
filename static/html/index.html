                <h1>Solo 5e Tools</h1>
                <p>A suite of tools for 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Solo Adventurers.</p>
                <p>
                    This app simply provides generators, tables, widgets, and random non-combat
                    encounter tables, new systems for playing solo, and many other resources. Unlike
                    group D&D, there is no accepted “way” to do solo adventuring. You discover what
                    system works best for you through playing a solo game, and then you build on
                    that. Part of the beauty of it really… you determine the flow of the game based
                    on what appeals to you. This is designed for use with is 5e rules, but can be
                    used as an agnostic tool also.
